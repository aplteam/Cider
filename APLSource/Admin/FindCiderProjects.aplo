⍝ Takes a starting point like "C:\" or "C:\Project" or "/users/<user-name>/projects" etc. and scans them for
⍝ Cider-managed projects. They are identified by hosting a file <cider.config> - if a folder host such a file
⍝ it is assumed to be managed by cider. Sub-folders of such a folder will be ignored since Cider does not allows
⍝ nested projects.
⍝ You may specify a function that can then act on each of these folders. If you just want a list without a function
⍝ doing anything useful, call it this way:
⍝ ({⍵} FindCiderProjects <starting-point>
