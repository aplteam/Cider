⍝ Might change the current directory.
⍝ First condition is that the current project is the first one opened in the WS.
⍝ If that's the case then the current dir is changed to the project's dir if Cider's global config file
⍝ does not carry an entry `GetGlobalAskForDirChange`.
⍝ If it does then it depends on its value:
⍝ 0 = No action is taken
⍝ 1 = The dir is changed
⍝ 2 = The user is asked whether she wants to change the dir
⍝ Returns 1 in case the dir was changed, otherwise 0.
