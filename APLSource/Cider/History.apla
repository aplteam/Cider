 '    * The "Sure you want to..." question asked by `]OpenProject` did not honour the `-import` flag'
 '* 0.48.0 ⋄ 2025-04-23'
 '  * Updating packages improved: now even later principal major versions can be handled if desired'
 '  * Reporting of later versions improved when opening a project'
 '  * Messages & checks in ]ProjectConfig -edit improved'
 '  * Result of `InjectTatinVars` has changed'
 '  * `]ListTatinDependencies -full` improved   '
 '  * Bug fixes        '
 '    * `]ListTatinDependencies [alias] -f` crashed because the alias was not handled '
 '    * `CreateConfigFile` crashed in case there is no `LINK` section, which is not mandatory anymore'
 '    * When a package that had a function on the "lx" config parameter was opened as a project, Cider did'
 '      not check "lx", let alone execute it'
 '    * `]OpenProject` did not check whether the source URL had changed when looking for the latest version'
 '    * No package update was attempted for install folders for which the "=<namespace>" syntax was used  '

 '  * Potentially BREAKING CHANGES'
 '    * When a project is opened and a file .linkconfig is found in the project''s source folder, its content is'
 '      now checked. If it contains nothing but stop & trace vectors and Link''s version number, then any '
 '      Link-related settings in Cider''s project config file are evaluated, and the user is told to reconcile'
 '      the two sources of Link options, and eventually to delete the LINK section in the project config file.'
 '    '
 '      If the file `linkconfig` contains more than just the Link version number and Stop and Trace vectors, '
 '      then the LINK section in the project config file (if any) will be ignored, and the user will be told'
 '      to delete it.'
 '    * The user command `]Cider.Make` was renamed; it''s now `]Cider.HowToMakeNewVersion` '
 '    * The user command `]Cider.RunTests` was renamed; it''s now `]Cider.HowToRunTests`'

 '    argument. Was almost certainly only used by the `]CloseProject` user command.'
 '  * `CloseProject` now processes the name of an unqualified namespace name by trying to find it in the '
 '    namespace it was called from.'
 '  * Development packages updated.'

 '    * The `TatinVars` namespace was created as a ref pointing to another namespace `TatinVars` which was'
 '      then deleted. That can cause confusion. Now the namespace is copied.'
 '    * `ListTatinDependencies` crashed under rare circumstances'
 '    * `AddTatinDependencies` (API function as well as user command) did not process a project alias (#99)     '
 '* 0.45.0 ⋄ 2024-12-09'
 '  * If the Dropbox check is not configured in the Cider config file, Cider now checks whether there is'

 '  * `]UpdateCider` now accepts an optional argument: a Cider version number'
 '  * Bug fixes                                                              '

 '    * `ProjectConfig`: did not return the expected result when editing was disallowed'
 '    * `Make` did not not ask for a change of the `Version` function anymore'
 '    * When a new Cider project was created and opened, Link complained about a trailing slash'
 '* 0.44.0 ⋄ 2024-11-16'
 '  * `]OpenProject`''s reporting on Git enhanced and streamlined'
 '  * Bug fixes'
 '    * The file `cider.config.template` wrongly came with a property `CIDER.version`. '
 '      As a result, `CreateProject` injected this wrongly into the new file `cider.config` '
 '* 0.43.2 ⋄ 2024-10-13'

 '* 0.43.0 ⋄ 2024-09-24'
 '  * `]OpenProject` now understands `-alias=.`, resulting in the name of the project in lowercase as alias.'
 '  * `ListTatinDependencies` now accepts the path to a package installation folder in addition to a project '
 '    folder and a project path'
 '  * The `-raw` flag has been removed from `ListTatinDependencies` - if you need raw data use the API'
 '  * `ListTatinDependencies -full` has been changed: it now reports always all installation folders without'
 '    asking questions'
 '  * The layout of `]ListTatinDependencies -full` has been changed'
 '  * Bug fixes'
 '    * Case problem fixed: `LoadNuGetDependencies` rather than `LoadNugetDependencies`'

 '    * Editing the list of aliases asks for cancellation now in case of a problem '
 '    * `CheckForDropboxConflicts` now ignores an empty path rather than crashing on it'
 '    * Packages updated    '
 '* 0.42.1 ⋄ 2024-07-12'
 '  * Cider now comes with Release Notes.'
 '  * Documentation of `CloseProject` and `CheckForDropBoxConflicts` polished.'
 '  * The ]Cider.Config file now prints the content of Cider''s global config file to the session, and there'
 '    is now an -edit flag but no -print flag anymore. That brings it in line with sinilar functions/commands'
 '    in both Cider and Tatin.'
 '  * ]Cider.ProjectConfig prints the contents of any project config file to the session unless the -edit flag'
 '    is specified. '
 '  * Bug fixes                        '
 '    * `CreateConfigFile` crashed on `##.tatinVars` when it should have addressed `tatinVars` instead.'

 '    * The API-function `CloseProject` failed when a ref was passed as a project'
 '    * `CloseProject` failed on a non-lowercase alias name'
 '* 0.42.0 ⋄ 2024-07-06'

 '  * `-watch=`, when specified, was not reported; now it is ALWAYS reported'
 '  * A [LINK] section in the Cider config file is from now on ignored in case there is a file .linkconfig;'
 '    the user will be informed'

 '    * `]ListDependencies` asked which package folder to act on even if there was only one'
 '    * `]ListDependencies -full` did not say anything if there are no dependencies'
 '    * The documentation claimed that a project initalisation function can be dyadic, but the code only accepted'
 '      niladic, monadic and ambivalent functions.'
 '    * The global Cider config file was not handled/created correctly'
 '    * Problem in the document "Cider-User-Guide" fixed'
 '    * `OpenProject` did not detect a Link error caused by an invalid config file '
 '    * Some minor fixes '

 '  * The user command `]ListTatinDependencies` now has two new flags: `-full` and `-raw`'
 '  * `]ListAlias` has a new flag `-scan=` which allows you to add all/some sub folders and their sub-folders (maximum '
 '    one level deep) of a given folder as aliases.'
 '  * New global parameter `CheckForDropboxConflicts` introduced. '
 '  * The user command interface has been slimmed: the "business logic" has been removed from the script and'
 '    been transformed into an ordinary namespace saved in `APLSource/`.'
 '  * The communication between Cider and the user in case Cider is opening itself has been improved.'
 '    This includes changes to the documentation.'
 '  * `CloseProject` has now a flag `fast` that closes projects without performing any checks (like `CheckForDropboxConflicts`)'
 '  * The check for a to-do list is now only performed when a project is opened rather than imported AND `batch` is 0'
 '  * The check for the Git status is performed only when the project was opened rather than imported and batch is 0 and'
 '    the global config parameter `ReportGitStatus` is not 0 and the project has a .git/ folder '
 '  * The current directory is only changed when the project was opened rather than imported and batch is 0'
 '  * Any user function is executed only when the project was opened rather than imported'
 '  * The check for Dropbox conflicts is executed only when the project was opened rather than imported and batch is 0 and the '
 '    global config parameter `CheckForDropboxConflicts` is 1 '
 '  * For developers a function `Admin.InstallCider` was added that works on all supported operating systems'
 '  * `AddTatinPackages` and `AddNuGetPackages` are now clear about why a project needs to be selected'
 '  * Bug fixes        '
 '    * `LoadNuGetDependencies` used a now invalid syntax for specifying a namespace'
 '    * With `noLoadPkgs←0` and `batch←1` Cider interrogated the user in case Tatin packages were missing. '
 '      It now silently re-installs them.'
 '    * The user command `]UpdateCider` now tells the user that the WS had not been updated '

 '    * `CloseProject` might have carried out unnecessary check functions'
 '    * The user commands `AddTatinPackages` and `AddNuGetPackages` crashed when no project was specified and "q" (for "quit")'

 '  * NuGet interface improved (tx Alexander Block)'
 '  * New global config parameter introduced: `AskForDirChange`'
 '  * New global config parameter introduced: `ReportGitStatus` '
 '  * The config property "tatinVars", when present, was used to establish which sub-namspace of a project'
 '    would eventually become a package. This was used in order to inject the namespace `TatinVars` into that'
 '    sub-namespace rather than the root of the project.'
 '    Now Cider always injects `TatinVars` into the root of the project, but in addition it establishes a '
 '    reference `TatinVars` in the sub-namespace defined by "tatinVars" pointing to `TatinVars` in the root of'
 '    the project. '
 '  * Bug fixes'
 '    * `]packageConfig -edit` did not update the workspace (`TatinVars`) '
 '    * OpenProject crashed when [?] was specified as argument but no aliases were defined'

 '  * Documentation improved'
 '  * New version of FilesAndDirs integrated which addresses the problem that RmDirByForce with ''/..'' dir not'
 '    work on Linux and Mac OS.'
 '  * Bug fix in `InjectTatinVars`: TatinVars was injected into the project root rather than the package root'
 '* 0.37.5 ⋄ 2023-11-07'
 '  * Bug fixes'
 '    * The user command ]UpdateCider signalled a VALUE ERROR in case it updated Cider sucessfully: missing explicit result.'
 '* 0.37.4 ⋄ 2023-10-13'
 '  * Bug fixes'
 '    * When attempting to open a package with NuGet dependencies in Dyalog priot 19.0 Cider kept silent over '
 '      the fact that such a version does not support NuGet. It now prints a message to the session.'
 '    * Reloading Tatin packages after using `AddTatinDependencies` sometimes failed.'
 '    * ListTatinPackages now prints "No dependencies found" to the session rather than returning an empty matrix.'
 '* 0.37.3 ⋄ 2023-10-10'
 '  * Installation folder was missing the `SessionExtensions` level'
 '* 0.37.2 ⋄ 2023-10-08'
 '  * In the documentation the function `LoadCider` was wrong: no left argument (1) was passed to `GetProgramFilesFolder`'
 '  * `OpenProject` did not give any feedback if no argument was specfied, no aliases were defined and the current dir is not a project folder'
 '* 0.37.1 ⋄ 2023-10-07'
 '  * Bug fix in `]Cider.UpdateCider`   '

 '  * Bug fixes'
 '    * `AddTatinDependencies` prints now better mesages to the session'
 '    * `GetCiderGlobalConfigFileContent` is now more robust and reports better messages'
 '    * Deleting everything in the editor window when a new project is about to be created should'
 '      have been treated as "cancel the process" but wasn''t'
 '* 0.36.0 ⋄ 2023-09-23'
 '  * Documentation now in line with latest changes to the installatin routine'
 '* 0.35.0 ⋄ 2023-09-22'
 '  * User commands implemented:'
 '    * `]Cider.AddTatinDependencies`'
 '    * `]Cider.AddNuGetDependencies`'
 '    * `]Cider.ListTatinDependencies`'
 '    * `]Cider.ListNuGetDependencies`'
 '  * API equivalents for the newly introduced user commands implemented: `AddTatinDependencies`, '
 '    `AddNuGetDependencies`, `ListTatinDependencies`, `ListNuGetDependencies`'
 '  * `OpenProject` now loads NuGet dependencies, if any'
 '  * The default of `checkPackageVersions` in `CreateOpenParms` is now 0, preventing the API function from'
 '    asking the user. (The user command `OpenProject` will asign `⍬` however)'
 '  * `]Cider.UpdateCider` added as a user command, though the corresponding API function is still missing'
 '  * Bug fixes:'
 '    * There were refs missing in the user command script in case of DEVELOPMENT←1'
 '* 0.34.0 ⋄ 2023-09-14'
 '  * `OpenProject` does not report anymore anything but serious stuff and final success to `⎕SE`, but watch '
 '    out for the global config parameter `verbose` and the user command flags `-verbose` and `-batch`'
 '  * `OpenProject`s `quiet` flag has been retired'
 '  * `OpenProject` has now a parameter `verbose` & `batch`; the latter is for tests & build procedures etc'
 '  * `]OpenProject` has now a -verbose flag and a `-batch` flag'
 '  * Cider honours a variable `verbose` in its global configuration file. By default no such file exists,'
 '    meaning that the default is 0. If it does exist it might or might nor carry `verbose`. '
 '  * Cider deletes Link-specific vars in its config file that equal their defaults anyway'
 '  * Under rare circumstances `]Cider.Help` produced an error ("File not found") rather than showing the help'
 '* 0.33.0 ⋄ 2023-09-05'
 '  * `Cider` is now an ordinary namespace rather than a class script.'
 '  * `LoadTatinPackages` now reports the URL the packages were loaded from, but only if they were loaded'

 '      did not fit to the dependency list and/or the build list'
 '    * Inconsistencies between the build list and the dependency file were not discovered. Now Cider'
 '      does a re-install if the user permits that.'
 '    * It was possible to load a package and then open it as a project; this is now prevented'
 '* 0.31.1 ⋄ 2023-08-05'
 '  * Version 0.30.0 wrongly pretended to be a beta release when it wasn''t'
 '* 0.31.0 ⋄ 2023-08-04'
 '  * Step added to `OpenProject`: checks for a non-empty variable `ToDo` in the root of the project now'
 '  * When Cider is asked for "Make" it checks for a variable `ToDo` now and reports its findings'
 '  * In case the user function `ExecuteAfterProjectOpen` is causing trouble the error message is more'
 '    prominently emphasized now.'
 '  * The newly introduced flag `ignoreUserExec` can be used to prevent the execution of the user function'
 '    by a particular call of `OpenProject`'
 '* 0.30.1 ⋄ 2023-07-23'
 '  * Bug fix in `CheckForTatinPackages`'
 '* 0.30.0 ⋄ 2023-07-07'
 '  * Without a parameter, OpenProject now offers all aliases for selection'
 '  * When `make` and/or `test` point to an APL object no error is thrown anymore. Instead a warning'
 '    is issued.'
 '  * Bug fix: new projects got a parameter `githubUsername` injected which is not used anymore'
