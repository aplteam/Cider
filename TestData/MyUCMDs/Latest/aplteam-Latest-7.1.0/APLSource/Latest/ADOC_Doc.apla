 '## Overview'
 ''
 '`]Latest` is designed to list the latest changes.'
 ''
 ' The main purpose of `]Latest` is to act on LINKed namespaces/their directores (no argument required at all).'
 '                            '
 'However, it can do more than that:'
 ''
 '* It can act on unlinked namespaces, meaning that you need to specify something like `#` or `⎕SE` or `#.Foo`'
 ''
 '  This limits `]Latest` powers, because scripts (classes, interfaces, scripted namespaces) do not own a timestamp '
 '  that could be used. When acting on the file system however, this information is available.'
 ''
 '* It can act on any un-linked folder like `C:\MyProjects\ThisProject\APLSource`'
 ''
 'By default the user command reports all objects or files changed lately (read: last day with any changes).'
 '  '
 'Note that in case a path or the `allFiles` flag was specified, all files in .git/ or its sub-directories are removed'
 'from the result since the user will almost never be interested in them.'
 ''
 '## The argument(s)'
 ''
 'When an argument is specified it must be one of:'
 ''
 '* An integer'
 '  * A positive one smaller than 10000000 (1E7) defines the number of objects/files to be listed.'
 '  * A positive integer larger than 9999999 is treated as a specific date (YYYYMMDD).'
 '  * A negative one defines the number of days with any changes. (Deprecated: use -days= instead)'
 '* A character vector; if it contains a `/` or a `\` it is treated as a directory, otherwise as a namespace path'
 '* A vector of length two with an integer and a character vector in no particular order, see above.'
 ''
 'In case no argument or only an integer is specified, `]Latest` will establish which namespaces are currently LINKed.'
 'If it is just one it will act on it. If there are multiple LINKs established, the user will be prompted.'
 ''
 '## FLags (options)        '
 ''
 '`-allFiles`'
 ''
 ': By default only files with extensions that are recognized as APL source files (`.aplf`, `.aplc` etc.) are'
 '  listed. You can force `]Latest` to consider all files by specifying this flag.'
 '  '
 ''
 '`-days=`'
 ''
 ': Use this to specify the number of days changes should be reported on. Don''t specify an integer as argument in case'
 '  you use this. If you do anyway, the integer will be ignored.'
 ''
 '  '
 '`-recursive=0|1`'
 ''
 ': The default is 1, meaning that the path is searched recursively;'
 '  if you don''t want this then specify a 0.'
 '       '
 '  '
 '`-stats`'
 ''
 ': If this flag is specified you get a matrix with two columns, the first'
 '  one with all unique dates and the second one with the number of objects changed '
 '  on that day. The number of rows is defined by the number of unique dates.'
 ''
 ': If `-stats` is specified any other flag will be ignored.'
 '  '
 ''
 '`-version`'
 ''
 ': Ignores any other flag and prints the version to the session'
