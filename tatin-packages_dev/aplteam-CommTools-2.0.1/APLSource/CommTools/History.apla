 '  * BREAKING CHANGES: '
 '    * You cannot specify part of a question/message/caption anymore, neither with nor without LF.'
 '      With version 2.0 you should use an alias if you have LF in your question/message/caption or if something '
 '      dynamic is part of it. (You can still use the wildcard character with `Select` for automation)'
 '    * Automation has been redesigned. There is now only one variable in charge for automation: `∆Automation`'
 '  * Helpers added for manipulating `∆Automation` and gaining information about automation: `AddAutomation`,'
 '    `ListAutomation` and `FindAutomationIndex`'
 '  * Testing can be done more thoroughly now thanks to the introduction of a counter on `∆Automation`'
 '  * `Version` now uses the Tatin config as source'
