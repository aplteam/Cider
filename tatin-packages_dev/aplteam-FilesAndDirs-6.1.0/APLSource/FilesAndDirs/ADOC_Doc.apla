 '## Overview'
 ''
 'This package provides functions that are useful for dealing with files and directories. '
 'They aim to be platform-independent.'
 ''
 'Note that error codes and messages may differ between operating systems for the same'
 'type of problem.'
 ''
 '## Characters to avoid in file names and paths'
 ''
 'Windows filenames cannot contain any of these characters: `\/:*?"<>|`.'
 'If you want platform-independent code, now or in the future,'
 'avoid using them even in Mac OS or Linux filenames.'
 ''
 '## Separators in file paths'
 ''
 'Dyalog tried to ease the pain by converting any `\` character into `/` on Windows.'
 'The idea of sticking always with the `/` as separator because it works anyway is'
 'attractive, but it creates new poblems: when you use third-party software such as a .NET'
 'assembly or an EXE like 7zip.exe on Windows, then you **must** use `\` as a separator.'
 'Even setting the `Directory` property of a `FileBox` object will fail with `/` as the separator,'
 'at least at the time I created `FilesAndDirs`.'
 ''
 'For platform independence it is essential that filenames and directory names are _normalized_.'
 'This means using the correct separator for the current operating system.'
 'Otherwise you could create a directory or file with a backslash in its name, which is disastrous'
 'on Linux or Mac OS.'
 ''
 'The `FilesAndDirs` functions protect you from this problem by normalizing your file paths.'
 'Use cover functions like `MkDir`, `NNAMES` and `NCREATE` etc. instead of the built-in system '
 'functions to overcome the problem.'
 ''
 '`⎕NCOPY` and `⎕NMOVE` (introduced in 17.0) are exceptions, but you can use the native function'
 'with the `ExecNfunction` operator.'
 'The `CurrentSep` method returns the correct separator for the current operating system.'
 ''
 'The `NormalizePath` method normalizes a file path for the current operating system.'
 ''
 'If you have a particular reason for using `/` under Windows or `\` under Linux'
 'or Mac OS then you can use the `EnforceBackslash` or `EnforceSlash` functions.'
 ''
 '## Misc'
 ''
 'This class supports Windows, Mac OS and Linux but has not been tested on either the Raspberry Pi '
 'or AIX.'
 ''
 '## `Dir` and `Dir2`'
 ''
 '`Dir` was designed to act recursively before `⎕NINFO` learned about recursion. As it turned out'
 '`⎕NINFO` with `recurse←1` is **way** faster then `Dir`. When I finally realized that I implemented '
 '`Dir2` and declared `Dir` to be deprecated. '
 ''
 'Apart from the formidable performance gain, the two should return the same result, but as it turned'
 'out `⎕NINFO` reduces the nesting level when it acts on a single file or a single directory, but'
 '`Dir` did not do this, it always keeps the same nesting level.'
 ''
 'It seemed unreasonable to change `Dir`, because it is likely to break some code. That''s why `Dir2`'
 'was created, which sticks with the `⎕NINFO` syntax. For a similar reason `Dir2` uses the keyword'
 '`recurse` for recursion, while `Dir`, introduced before `⎕NINFO` learned about recursion, uses'
 '`recursive`. '
 ''
 'Also, `Dir` implemented `depth` earlier than `⎕NINFO`, and differently. `Dir2` again follows closely'
 'the `⎕NINFO` syntax.'
