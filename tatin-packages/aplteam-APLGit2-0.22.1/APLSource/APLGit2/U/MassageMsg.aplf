⍝ This function exchanges all single quotes and all double quotes against ticks (`).
⍝ Note that under Windows a message MUST NOT be enclosed between single quotes,
⍝ and that means we cannot escape quotes, so using a substitute is the only way.
⍝ Having said this, on a Mac (and ONLY the Mac) backticks must be escaped.
