⍝ Returns a list with all APL objects/files that are different compared with HEAD.
⍝ r is a matrix with two columns and zero or more rows.
⍝ If `verbose` is 1 (default is 0) then a full report is returned instead.
⍝ `y` must be one of:
⍝   * Fully qualfied name of a namespace  that is an opened Cider project
⍝   * Fully qualified path to a Git-managed project
⍝ `verbose` defaults to 0 which gives you a short report.
