⍝ If `path` is nested it will return a vector of the same length as `path`
⍝ * If `path` exists but is not a directory a 0 is returned.\\
⍝ * If `path` does not exist a 0 is returned.\\
⍝ * If `path` does not exist but the left argument is "CREATE!" it will be created,
⍝ including any sub directories.\\
⍝ The left argument is case insensitive.
